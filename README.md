# PyCharm_Coding_Project

This project uses an external dependency, Folium. To ensure this protect can correctly run and operate, Folium must be installed.

In this project I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sehqvtIHvg as a guide of creating my map. I changed some key aspects to make it my own map 
(e.g., location, icon on the marker etc.

I also used https://fontawesome.com/icons/1?f=classic&s=solid to find the desired icon. To use this I used the code they provided for the icon to work,
as well as telling my code I was using the prefix 'fa' which stands for 'font-awesome'.

I have also included the imagaes I used for each marker.

My file of coding is under 'main.py.' However to successfully run the project you also need to use the 'map.html'.
